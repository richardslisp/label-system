What if I wrote a function in emacs lisp that edited the XML then output it as a string to a file with a btbat extension, that file is then opened. Test with dolav labels.


(defun dolav-labels ()
  (interactive)
  (setq theoutputfile "C:/Documents and Settings/S12Despatch.SML/Desktop/dolavs.btbat")
  (write-region 
   (format
"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>
<XMLScript Version=\"2.0\">
  <Command>
    <Print>
      <Format CloseAtEndOfJob=\"true\" SaveAtEndOfJob=\"false\">P:/BARTENDER LABELS/BARTENDER LABELS/Primary Prep/CATEGORY 3.btw</Format>
      <PrintSetup>
        <IdenticalCopiesOfLabel>%d</IdenticalCopiesOfLabel>
      </PrintSetup>
    </Print>
  </Command>
</XMLScript>" (read-number "How many dolav labels do you want to print?")) nil 'theoutputfile)
  (async-shell-command "C:/Documents and Settings/S12Despatch.SML/Desktop/dolavs.btbat")
  )
